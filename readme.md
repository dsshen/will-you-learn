# Will You Learn

I trained a recurrent neural network to write 8-bar pop hooks, then turned one of its generated hooks into an EDM pop single.

You can listen to the song [here](https://soundcloud.com/dshen28/will-you-learn).

A full write-up of the process can be found [here](https://github.com/dsshen/will-you-learn/blob/master/shen_daniel.pdf). A slide deck for a presentation on the project that I gave to the Princeton Department of Music can be found [here](https://github.com/dsshen/will-you-learn/blob/master/shen_daniel_thesis_presentation.pdf).

Source code can be found in the `src` directory.
